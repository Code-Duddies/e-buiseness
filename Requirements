So where to start...

Main page
-> search bar with filter settings (notes, homeworks, events...)
-> settings - color settings (atleast dark and white but other colorschemes could be cool too), font size, tab to space convertor, motivational remineders(frequency, type of notification...),turn off and on other features...{more customizable more happy students ðŸ¤£}
-> small summary of events comming up in the next few days
-> small summary of homeworks
-> summary of recent notes added
-> notification button to open and shhow notification with link to part of the app, also quick sleep butoon to turn them off
-> bar (probably on left) to jum to notes, calendar, homework/toDo list
...

Notes
-> add cutome subjects or choose from predefined ones
-> each subject - 
---> ability to create/delete notes files
-----> print button for each note file
-----> change font, color, size...
-----> bullet points
---> button to quick add homework so you dont have to go to homework tab

Calendar
-> basic calendar, easily readable
-> click on day to add event, homework due
-> ability to view colorcordinated events, homeworks

Homeworks
